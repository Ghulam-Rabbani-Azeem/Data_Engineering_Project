Title

Analyzing the Impact of Renewable Energy Adoption on U.S. Carbon Emissions

Main Question

How does renewable energy adoption across different sectors and states in the U.S. impact carbon dioxide emissions?

Description

The transition to renewable energy sources is a critical component in addressing climate change. This project seeks to analyze the relationship between renewable energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. Using advanced data engineering techniques, we will integrate and process datasets on renewable energy consumption and CO₂ emissions to identify patterns, correlations, and actionable insights. By leveraging statistical analysis and visualization, this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of how renewable energy impacts emissions and inform strategies for sustainable development.
