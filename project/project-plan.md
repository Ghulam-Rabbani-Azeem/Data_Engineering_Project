# Project Plan: Analyzing Renewable Energy Impact on Carbon Emissions

## **Title**
**"Analyzing the Relationship Between Renewable Energy Consumption and Carbon Dioxide Emissions Across Sectors in the United States (1973–2024)"**

## **Main Question**
How does renewable energy consumption influence carbon dioxide emissions across sectors in the United States?

## **Description**
With the rising urgency of climate change, understanding the dynamics between renewable energy adoption and carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions is crucial. This project aims to analyze renewable energy consumption data and CO₂ emissions data across various sectors in the United States from 1973 to 2024. By cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data, we will identify trends, sector-specific impacts, and actionable insights for policymakers to enhance sustainability initiatives. This includes statistical analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to reveal correlations, trends, and improvement opportunities for the adoption of renewable energy.
