# Project Plan

## Title
**Analyzing the Impact of Renewable Energy Adoption on National Carbon Emissions and Economic Growth (2010-2020)**

## Main Question
**How has the adoption of renewable energy sources impacted national carbon emissions and economic growth from 2010 to 2020?**

## Description
Transitioning to renewable energy is a critical component in addressing climate change while ensuring economic growth. This project investigates how renewable energy adoption from 2010 to 2020 has influenced national carbon emissions and economic performance. By analyzing renewable energy data, carbon emissions, and GDP growth, the study aims to uncover significant trends and relationships that can inform future policies.

### Objectives:
- Determine whether countries with higher renewable energy adoption achieved notable reductions in carbon emissions.
- Assess whether renewable energy investments have positively or negatively impacted economic growth.
- Provide actionable insights for balancing sustainability with economic development.
